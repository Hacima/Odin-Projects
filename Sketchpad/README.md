#Sketchpad

This is a sketchpad program for [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home). Try it out [here!](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Hacima/Odin-Projects/blob/master/Sketchpad/index.html)
The requirements for the program are as follows:
- Create a 16x16 square of divs with javascript or jQuery.
- Set up a hover effect to change the color of the square that your mouse passes over.
- Add a button to clear the grid and ask the user for the number of squares per side to be generated. The new grid must be generated in the same total space.
- Optional 1: Make each square change to a random color on every pass through with the mouse.
- Optional 2: Make each square become 10% darker on every pass through with the mouse.

My improvements:
- Instead of color changing on mouseover, I set it up to only change the colors upon click or click and drag. This allows for greater precision, more like MS Paint.
- The reset button simply changes all colors to black. If the user wants a different sized canvas, there is a seperate button for that.
- I added a number of preset colors that users can select and paint with.
- I made the optional challenges selectable by the user.
- I added the ability to redraw the entire canvas with random colors.
