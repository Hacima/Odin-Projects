# Odin-Projects
This is where I will store all of the projects that I start, and hopefully complete, for [The Odin Prject](http://www.theodinproject.com/home) website.

I'm having a blast with this course so far. It's definitely making me consider a serious career in web development. The only thing it lacks is feedback, so if anyone out there stumbles across this repo, please feel free to critique anything here. I would love to know what I can be improving on.
